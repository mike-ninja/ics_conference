        <p>
          INDIGENOUS CONFERENCE SERVICES (ICS-MEES PTY LTD) is totally 100%
          Indigenous owned. The absolute core and soul of our company is our
          people and culture. We believe that the people who make up ICS have a
          commitment to First Nations affairs both through their work life and
          experiences. Our motto is be positive, be strong, be independent, and
          always walk the walk and talk the talk. Over the years, we have built
          the most experienced Indigenous Conference Management team you will
          find worldwide. Since opening our doors, we have clocked up an
          impressive array of events both within Australia and internationally.
