        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          ICS has organised conferences up to 6,500 delegates, festivals up to
          70,000 over two (2) days and thousands of smaller conferences and
          events. We offer a wide range of services from total event management
          to marketing and even a free of charge service for conference venues.
          One of the most important contributions toward a successful event is
          the correct choice of location and venue. Organising an Indigenous
          specific conference is not the same as organising a mainstream event.
          We believe there are several major differences that we adhere too.
